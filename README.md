## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirhosssein0/Loan-Credit-Predict.git
   cd Loan-Credit-Predict

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run the prediction:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

🧠 How it Works

The main.py script processes new input data, applies preprocessing, then uses the trained model to predict loan approval status. The output is displayed or saved to a file.
